Sarthak:
1) Good report, thank you for your study in ES. I think, by now, you must have got a good overview of ES already.
2) As discussed in call, please try to finalize a Responsive+JS+Backend framework for the Uhura project, for creating the functional web app.
	a) You can consider from Bootstrap/SemantiUI/Materialize for responsive
	b) You can consider AngularJS or ExpressJS etc for front-end
	c) You can consider NodeJS or Python/Django or SpringMVC/Java etc

3) Please try to think on the web-page design schematics also and please share if you have any designs thought of.

Jagriti:
1) Good, thank you for the report.
2) Please think on the design of the website, various layers to use, various interfaces (such as how to query data from ES, how to query data from NodeJS etc)
